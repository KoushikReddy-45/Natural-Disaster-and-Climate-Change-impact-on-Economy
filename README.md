🌍 Natural Disasters & Climate Change: Impact on the Global Economy
📌 Overview

This project explores the relationship between climate change, natural disasters, and their economic impact. Using datasets on global CO₂ emissions, temperature anomalies, disaster frequency, fatalities, and financial losses, the analysis highlights how rising climate anomalies are linked to increasing disaster severity and global economic risks.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze global trends in natural disaster frequency and severity (2000–2022)

Explore the relationship between CO₂ emissions and global temperature anomalies

Assess economic losses and human fatalities caused by disasters

Map regional differences in climate change and disaster impacts

Highlight the distribution of global economic power and its exposure to climate risks

📊 Visualizations

The project includes:

📈 Line & Bar Charts – CO₂ trends, disaster counts, GDP comparisons

🌐 Geographic Maps – Regional disaster frequency and temperature anomalies

🔄 Animated Visualizations – Global temperature and CO₂ emissions change over decades

📉 Correlation Analysis – CO₂ emissions vs. weighted temperature anomalies

📊 Interactive Dashboard – Bringing together disasters, emissions, fatalities, and economy

📌 Key Insights

Natural disasters have increased in frequency and severity since 2000.

Rising CO₂ emissions and global temperature anomalies strongly correlate with disaster trends.

Economic losses are highest in developed economies, but developing regions suffer greater human impact.

The top global economies face growing risks from climate-related disasters.
